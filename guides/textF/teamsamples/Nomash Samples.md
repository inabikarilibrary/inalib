# Nomash team samples for beginners

**IMPORTANT: All of these teams are teams that I believe are the most beginner-friendly, and as such it is subject to personal opinion.**

***Guidelines for all teams:***
- Use 'Deep Jungle' as the defense move for Torb, Kazemaru and Sakuma 
- Use 'Pegasus Break' as the dribble move for Tenmas Tenma
- You may notice that the teams have basically the same 5 players in the backline (and GK). I personally think this core is the most consistent and versatile, and is easy to use for new players 

****Team 1: Standard****

A stable team with no funny gimmicks or strats,  without a need of any complicated halftime procedures outside of simply substituting in your keymen.
You may swap Shuu with Mark Kruger as you prefer depending on aesthetics. Make sure to place your Tenmas Tenma as a FW
and your Raimon Tenma as a side MF, and not the other way around. 

****Team 2: Killer Fields****

Arguably easier than Standard, but it depends on your playstyle and preference. There is a slightly smaller emphasis on dashing here, since Fudou and Kidou cannot
dash. As a result, it may be simpler to use for those who cannot dash cancel. As a tradeoff, against a "regular" defense, Killer Fields may bring more firepower 
than Standard.  

****Team 3: Opening Hakuryuu****

In the 1st half, this team revolves around Hakuryuu and the cheese strat that you can perform with him. When you send a high pass to a player that can miximax, that
player can activate their miximax while the ball is in mid-air. What this does is knockout all defenders near Hakuryuu before they can even do anything. This clears 
a path to an easy Single Rush nomash to score a very early goal. Note that a high level of consistency for performing Single Rush is needed here more than the other teams
due to it being the key strength of the strat. 

During halftime, swap Hakuryuu out for a strong dribbler like Shuu or Tenmas Tenma. However, if you believe you are skilled enough to play hybrid, you can keep him in
and use him as a chainer once his miximax runs out. You may also give Shuu the shooting move 'Sword Excalibur' to use together with Hakuryuu, as it is an extremely
powerful shoot that can score against many goalkeepers.

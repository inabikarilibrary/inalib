# Chain team samples for beginners

**IMPORTANT: All of these teams are teams that I believe are the most beginner-friendly, and as such it is subject to personal opinion.**

***Guidelines for all teams:***
- Use 'Deep Jungle' as the defense move for Torb, Kazemaru and Sakuma 
- Use 'Maximum Fire' as the chain move for Gouenji and Genius
- Aside from their strongest chain shooting move, remove all other Lvl1/2 chain moves (labelled with a 'C' next to the name) for your front 3 players
- Remove Sakuma's Lvl3 shooting move 'Koutei Penguin 1gou'
- Remove Saru's Lvl1 shooting move 'Mach Wind'
- During halftime, substitute Gamma with Saru
- You may notice that the teams have basically the same 5 players in the backline (and GK). I personally think this core is the most consistent and versatile, and is easy to use for new players 

****Team 1: Standard****

This is a very standard team created by Paraly. It boasts solid power, coverage and is easy to pilot as you do not need to make any halftime adjustments to your front 3 chainers. Canon and Gouenji also have good synergy as a chain duo. Alternatively, Canon can be replaced with Fideo if you prefer better versatility.

****Team 2: Opening Shindou****

A strat originating from way back in the vanilla days, the Shindou Opening allows you to cheese a lot of free early goals. When you have the kickoff in the 1st half, the procedure is simple: 

Pass to Shindou and miximax him, then pass it down to Gamma and miximax him too. Shoot with Gamma's Lvl3 shooting move 'Gamma Strike' and chain with Shindou.

Because the match is still so early in its beginning, none of your opponent's defenders are charged to block the shot. This is a near-guaranteed goal against almost every goalkeeper except for Senguuji and Genda, who are Shindou counters. Genius will complete the duo as he is counters Senguuji and is solid against Genda. Zanark is placed as a side MF to punish Senguuji and Genda as well. Although it is not as straightforward if your opponent gets the 1st half kickoff, this strat can still be very effective.

During halftime, substitute Shindou with Fideo and play as normal. 

****Team 3: 3x Gouenji****

As the name suggests, this team uses 3 Gouenjis as the front 3: 1st Raimon Gouenji, Fifth Sector Gouenji (Ishido), and Legend Japan Gouenji. This strat involves brute forcing your way through the enemy defense and goalkeeper. R1 Gouenji's S charging time allows for 3x/4x chains through the middle to be done more often, which allows the final shot to be strong enough to beat even Endou and Shinsuke, Gouenji's counters. Even a Gamma Strike into Maximum Fire can be enough to score against Endou and Shinsuke with decent rng.

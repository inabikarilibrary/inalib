## What are halftime items? 

Halftime items are consumable items that can be given to players to give them certain benefits.

In online play, only 3 of these items can be used during halftime.

The 3 items and their effects will be detailed below.

### Cookie Flavor <img width="168" alt="cookie flavor" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110833255/183857106-a97a3528-ebe5-49f2-b462-ede2cbf87aca.png">


The recieving player will recover 100 TP.

### Ramen <img width="76" alt="ramen" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110833255/183857146-c1363fa9-b012-4354-9aec-b423701a3a6e.png">


The recieving player will recover 75 TP, as well as have their gauge filled by half coming into the 2nd half.



**NOTE**: the restored TP from _Cookie Flavor_ and _Ramen_ will not exceed the player's maximum TP. 

### Inazuma Candy <img width="161" alt="inazuma candy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110833255/183857302-7cd3183e-2f3b-4f9a-9fac-5965175fc133.png">


The recieving player's charge time rank is increased by one (e.g. Charge Time Rank from A -> S), thus their gauge will fill faster. 
In other words, the time it takes for their gauge to reach maximum is reduced.
